# Transport-Protocol-Servers
CPSC 441 Assignment 2

Implementation of three different microservices that utilize a UDP connection 
and an indirect server that allows telnet to communicate with all three services at the same time.

The services are:
a translation service that translates singular words that are hard-coded,
a currency exchange service that supports 5 different currencies,
and a voting service that simulates an actual election vote.
